    <p><strong>Firewalls</strong> are pretty solid pieces of hardware/software which filter the network activities
        based on defined rules by the admin or user. Their only job is to <strong>accept</strong> or <strong>reject</strong> a network
        packet. This makes it extremely difficult to initiate a cyberattack on hosts. This is because if we do
        try to, it will block the connection since they never initiated the connection <strong><em>first</em></strong>, a <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/reverse-shell/">reverse shell</a> 
        gets the user to connect to the attacker which effectively, bypasses the firewall for the attacker.
